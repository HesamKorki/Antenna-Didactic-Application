# **Anthenna Didactic Application**

#### **Using Java**

*Welcome to my repository of Anthenna Instructive Application. We visualized some of basic concepts of Anthenna course for a better comprehension.*

The application has seven parts that we will be delving into every one of them separately. In the application each part has an executable button.

## **Persian Glossary**

- By pressing this button the application will open the excel file of glossary
- These are particular expressions from "Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design" Book by Constantine A. Balanis from chapter two "Fundamental parameters of Anthennas"

## **Kraus and Tai Chart**

The goal of this part is to compare Exact and Approximate Values(e.g Kraus equation and Tai equation) of Maximum Directivity for U = pow((cos θ),2) Power Patterns.
By clicking on the the button a window pops open and it shows a figure of directivities simultaneously with different colors. Consequently, one can understand the differences and apprehend the resemblences.The corresponding java code for this part is presented in the problem2.java. Red line presents the exact value of directivity, and the orange line and green line represent Kraus and Tai approximations, respectively.

## **Calculation of Directivity**
