# **Antenna Didactic Application**

#### **Using Java**

*Welcome to my repository of Antenna Instructive Application. We visualized some of the basic concepts of Antenna course for better comprehension.*

The application has seven parts that we will be delving into every one of them separately. In the application, each section has an executable button.

## **Persian Glossary**

- By pressing this button, the application will open the excel file of glossary
- These are particular expressions from "Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design" Book by Constantine A. Balanis from chapter two "Fundamental parameters of Antennas."

## **Kraus and Tai Chart**

- The goal of this part is to compare Exact and Approximate Values(e.g. Kraus equation and Tai equation) of Maximum Directivity for U = pow((cos θ),2) Power Patterns.
- By clicking on the button, a window pops open, and it shows a figure of directivities simultaneously with different colors. Consequently, one can understand the differences and apprehend the resemblance. The corresponding java code for this part is presented in the solution/problem2.java.
- Red line shows the exact value of directivity, and the orange line and green line represent Kraus and Tai approximations, respectively.

## **Calculation of Directivity**

- The goal of this part is to calculate directivity for arbitrary angles of a "cos distributed power" antenna.
- By clicking on the button, a window pops open to let the operator choose his/her arbitrary values; then by clicking on ok, another window containing the directivity value opens. 
- The corresponding java code for this part is also presented in the solution/problem2.java.

## **PLF Calculator**

- The goal of this part is to calculate PLF(Polarization Loss Factor) with two inputs: 1- E_t(Transmitted Electrical Field)
2- E_r(Received Electrical Field)
- Inputs should be in the given format. To delineate, every field should be put by two complex numbers and a comma between them.
- By clicking on the button, a window pops open to let the operator choose his/her arbitrary values; then by clicking on ok, another window containing the PLF value opens.
- The corresponding java code for this part is presented in the solution/problem3.java.

## **Polarization Calculator**

- The goal of this part is to identify the polarization between two arbitrary fields(e.g. Ex and Ey)
- There are three different possible polarization: 1- LP(Linear Polarization) 2- CP(Circular Polarization) 3-EP(Elliptical Polarization)
- Inputs should be in the given format. To delineate, every field should be put by a complex number.
- By clicking on the button, a window pops open to let the operator choose his/her arbitrary values; then by clicking on ok, another window containing the Polarization type opens.
- The corresponding java code for this part is also presented in the solution/problem3.java.

## **Calculating Pr Using Friis Equation**

- The goal of this part is to calculate Pr(Power received) from the Friis equation.
- Inputs are Pt(Power transmitted), f(frequency), R(Resistance), G(Gain of the antenna) and two vectors that should be added with a format commensurate to the previous parts.
- By clicking on the button, a window pops open to let the operator choose his/her arbitrary values; then by clicking on ok, another window containing the Pr value opens.
- The corresponding java code for this part is presented in the solution/problem4.java.
